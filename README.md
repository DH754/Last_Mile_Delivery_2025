# Next Step

Analyze routes with the longest delivery times and identify bottlenecks. Implement route optimization algorithms to find the most efficient paths

# Route Optimization

Bottleneck Analysis:
Traffic Jam is the most common factor in the longest delivery times.
Weather Conditions: Fog, Windy, Sandstorms, and Stormy weather contribute significantly.
Location Type: Most delays occur in Metropolitan areas, with some in Semi-Urban and Urban areas.
Vehicle Type: All the longest delivery times involve motorcycles.

# Next Step
I'll implement a route optimization algorithm, considering factors like traffic conditions, weather, and shortest path calculations. I'll use geospatial analysis to suggest more efficient routes. Letâ€™s start by computing optimized paths based on store and drop-off coordinates.

To implement a route optimization algorithm that considers factors like traffic conditions, weather, and shortest path calculations, we can follow these steps:

Data Preparation: Extract relevant columns from the dataset, such as Store_Latitude, Store_Longitude, Drop_Latitude, Drop_Longitude, Weather, and Traffic.
Geospatial Analysis: Use geospatial libraries like geopy or osmnx to calculate the shortest path between the store and drop-off locations. We can also use routing APIs like Google Maps API or OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for more accurate and real-time route calculations.
Factor Integration: Incorporate traffic and weather conditions into the route optimization. For example, if the weather is "Stormy" or traffic is "Jam," the algorithm should prioritize routes that avoid these conditions.
Optimization Algorithm: Implement an optimization algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm) to find the most efficient route based on the calculated factors.
Visualization: Optionally, visualize the optimized routes on a map using libraries like folium or plotly.
Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Data Preparation

First, let's extract the relevant columns from the dataset:

python
Copy
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('amazon_delivery.csv')

# Extract relevant columns
df = df[['Store_Latitude', 'Store_Longitude', 'Drop_Latitude', 'Drop_Longitude', 'Weather', 'Traffic']]
2. Geospatial Analysis

We'll use the osmnx library to calculate the shortest path between two points. If you don't have osmnx installed, you can install it using pip install osmnx.

python
Copy
import osmnx as ox
import networkx as nx

# Define a function to calculate the shortest path
def calculate_shortest_path(origin_point, destination_point, traffic, weather):
    # Load the graph for the area (you can specify the location)
    G = ox.graph_from_point(origin_point, dist=5000, network_type='drive')
    
    # Find the nearest nodes to the origin and destination points
    origin_node = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G, origin_point[1], origin_point[0])
    destination_node = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G, destination_point[1], destination_point[0])
    
    # Calculate the shortest path
    route = nx.shortest_path(G, origin_node, destination_node, weight='length')
    
    return route

# Example usage
origin_point = (df['Store_Latitude'][0], df['Store_Longitude'][0])
destination_point = (df['Drop_Latitude'][0], df['Drop_Longitude'][0])
traffic = df['Traffic'][0]
weather = df['Weather'][0]

route = calculate_shortest_path(origin_point, destination_point, traffic, weather)
3. Factor Integration

We can adjust the weight of the edges in the graph based on traffic and weather conditions. For example, if the traffic is "Jam," we can increase the weight of the edges in that area.

python
Copy
def adjust_weights_for_traffic_and_weather(G, traffic, weather):
    for u, v, data in G.edges(data=True):
        if traffic == 'Jam':
            data['length'] *= 1.5  # Increase the weight for traffic jam
        if weather == 'Stormy':
            data['length'] *= 2.0  # Increase the weight for stormy weather
    return G

# Adjust weights based on traffic and weather
G = adjust_weights_for_traffic_and_weather(G, traffic, weather)

# Recalculate the shortest path with adjusted weights
route = nx.shortest_path(G, origin_node, destination_node, weight='length')
4. Optimization Algorithm

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm to find the shortest path. The networkx library already implements these algorithms, so we can use them directly.

python
Copy
# Using Dijkstra's algorithm
route = nx.shortest_path(G, origin_node, destination_node, weight='length')

# Using A* algorithm
def heuristic(u, v):
    return ox.distance.great_circle(G.nodes[u]['y'], G.nodes[u]['x'], G.nodes[v]['y'], G.nodes[v]['x'])

route = nx.astar_path(G, origin_node, destination_node, heuristic=heuristic, weight='length')
5. Visualization

Finally, we can visualize the optimized route on a map using folium.

python
Copy
import folium

# Create a map centered at the origin point
m = folium.Map(location=origin_point, zoom_start=13)

# Add the route to the map
route_coordinates = [(G.nodes[node]['y'], G.nodes[node]['x']) for node in route]
folium.PolyLine(route_coordinates, color="blue", weight=2.5, opacity=1).add_to(m)

# Add markers for the origin and destination
folium.Marker(origin_point, popup="Origin").add_to(m)
folium.Marker(destination_point, popup="Destination").add_to(m)

# Display the map
m.save('optimized_route.html')
Conclusion

This implementation provides a basic framework for route optimization considering traffic and weather conditions. For a production-level solution, you may want to integrate more sophisticated routing APIs, real-time traffic data, and machine learning models to predict traffic and weather impacts more accurately.
